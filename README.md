# amiga-large-cli
Do you boot your Amiga to the CLI instead of the Workbench? 
Are you using an PAL Amiga? 
Are you using an older Kickstart version prior to version 3+?
Are you annoyed that you have to resize the window manually to the full PAL resolution? 
Then this small tool will make your live much easier!

Simply add it to your startup-sequence and your CLI will resize to use the full PAL resolution.

This is how your CLI will look like without Large-CLI:

And this is how it will look like when you add the tool to your startup-sequence:

!["With Large-CLI"](https://github.com/LutzGrosshennig/amiga-large-cli/images/WithLargeCli.jpg) "With Large-CLI"

Written back in the days of Kickstart 1.2 around 1987 I guess...

# Kickstart 3.0

Kickstart 3.0 will adjust automatically to the correct resultion so there is no need for the this tool in such enviorments.
