# amiga-large-cli
Do you boot your Amiga to the CLI instead of the Workbench? 
Are you using an PAL Amiga? 
Are you using an older Kickstart version prior to version 3?
Are you annoyed that you have to resize the CLI window manually to the full PAL resolution every time? 
Then this small tool will make your live much easier!

Simply add it to your startup-sequence and your CLI will resize to use the full PAL resolution.

This is how your CLI will look like without Large-CLI:

And this is how it will look like when you add the tool to your startup-sequence:

Written back in the days of Kickstart 1.2 around 1987 I guess...

# Kickstart 3.0

Kickstart 3.0 will adjust automatically to the correct resolution so there is no need for this tool in such enviorments.
